# UAVFleetRL

## Overview
UAVFleetRL is a project that employs reinforcement learning techniques, specifically using Dirichlet policy, for task allocation in UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) fleets. This project aims to optimize the allocation of tasks among multiple UAVs to maximize efficiency and overall mission success.

## Features
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Utilizes reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly Dirichlet policy, to learn optimal task allocation strategies.
- **UAV Fleet Management**: Manages the allocation of tasks among a fleet of UAVs, considering factors such as task priorities, UAV capabilities, and environmental constraints.
- **Dynamic Environment Adaptation**: Adapts task allocation strategies in real-time to respond to changes in mission requirements, environmental conditions, and UAV availability.
- **Performance Optimization**: Seeks to optimize various performance metrics such as task completion time, resource utilization, and overall mission success rate through learning and adaptation.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/UAVFleetRL.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main script to start training the reinforcement learning agents or to deploy learned policies for task allocation in a simulated environment.

## Contribution
Contributions to UAVFleetRL are encouraged! Whether it's enhancements to the reinforcement learning algorithms, improvements to task allocation strategies, or the addition of new features, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
